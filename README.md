# Snakes and Ladders (As I wrote the snippet in python , my _imagination_ suggested me to give it the name -"Python and ladder".)
# You can think it as a PLACEHOLDER name for Snakes and Ladders (known originally as **Moksha Patam**).
## This is an ancient Indian board game for two or more players.
- It is played on a game board with numbered, gridded squares.
- A number of "ladders" and "snakes" are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares.
- The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece, according to die rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square), helped by 
  climbing ladders but hindered by falling down snakes.

And, I always used to play this cynosure board-game with my sister.

Idea behind this:-
(Single-player)
On one fine day , when I was busy with pydroid in my mobile to drag the logic from my neural-network (people call it as brain)for the below pattern

1 2 3 4 5 <br/>
10 9 8 7 6 <br/>
11 12 13 14 15 <br/>
20 19 18 17 16 <br/>
21 22 23 24 25 <br/>

my idea was to print this pattern with n rows and n columns based on only one input i.e, n

so I wrote the code for the above one after few trials and finally I started giving the varying inputs...1 then 4 then 5 and so on..

when I gave 10 , the output was something like this :-

This pattern ,  which looked alike similar to the board pattern of snake and ladder game(of course I've imagined it as the board game without any snake or any ladder.)

So, I thought writing an instruction based board game(easy to understand for newbies who are new to this board game,not confined with the rules etc...)

Especially I've decided to write this code using only the imperative and conditional python programming.

and THE CODE IS STILL UNDER IMPROVISATION .There are few minor bugs. I've to include further changes and I've to check whether the game is working properly or not according to the constraints embedded inside the code.

In this instruction based game , after every time the player gets a random output in range 1 to 6 , I want the code to work in such way that it , along with the upcoming instruction , should display the status of the player.

For that , after every action , the code should print the below pattern and a special symbol should be used to denote the position of the player **(it's position gets updated according to the random value in range 1 to 6).
